I generated the program in Python 3. Here are the instructions for making a number guessing game in Python:

We initially asked the user to choose the range for the number to be created. A random integer is created using the randint() function from the unexpected package.
We started a variable with 0 to keep track of the total predictions made.
We executed the while loop until the number estimated was not equal to the actual number.
We used an if-else ladder to check whether the estimated number is lower or greater than the actual number and increase the total guesses in each iteration.
We broke out of the loop when the estimate matched the number.
We displayed the total guesses made when the guess was accurate.
Similarly replicating the logic, we may make this game in Python 2 or any other computer language.
