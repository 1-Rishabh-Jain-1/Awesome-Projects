Tic Tac Toe

Some major points that help you understand the structure of the code.

We have used a class to have all the methods in one place. It can easily be a reusable bundle in some other code as well.
Next, we have defined different functions for each responsibility, even if it is a small task. It helps to maintain the code with ease.
The above two approaches help us update the app effortlessly if we want to update the game.
Feel free to adapt the structure and improve it based on your project. Structuring the code is not limited.
